# Get Help from the Community

### Get help from the community and Any Team!

Are you looking for some help building and using your Anytype? If these docs didn't help you enough, you can always check and see if someone in the community has asked a similar question.&#x20;

If you need suggestions of what to build or inspiration from seeing how others are using Antype, you can find an abundance here.&#x20;

This is the place to get some assistance or shout-out if you have questions unrelated to feature requests or bugs!

### Don't forget Trail Guides!

A resource hub of technical procedures, tutorials, and demos for various aspects of Anytype.
