# Objects

### What is an Object?

Forget what you already know about knowledge management tools.&#x20;

At Anytype we have created the concept that everything you create is an Object. Pages, Notes, Recipes, Books, Movies, Audio, Humans, _everything!_&#x20;

These are all **Objects** that are organized and categorized by **Types**.&#x20;

You can connect different **Types** by **Relations** and see how this is visualized on the **Graph**.

You will see in your **Library** that you can create new Types.&#x20;

In short, an Object is a generalizing term for what you are creating. If it is a page, note, or other Type that you have created.&#x20;

The Object will be organized by the Type of object that it is. &#x20;

It is any node in your graph. The smallest linkable unit. Still classified with types. &#x20;
