# Add a New Relation

#### Adding & Managing Relations <a href="#adding-and-managing-relations" id="adding-and-managing-relations"></a>

You can add a Relation to your Objects as you would with any other block in the editor: by using the `+` button or the in-line `/` menu. You can also manage the Relations for a given Object via its **Relations Panel:** the triangular icon that appears in the top right corner of the screen. This Panel shows all relations for that Object.

**Featuring Relations**

Here you can add, feature, or modify existing Relations. Featuring Relations allows you to visually prioritize the most relevant Relations for a given Object, as Featured Relations appear directly beneath the Title. You can feature any Relation by clicking â˜… next to the relation in the Relations panel.
