# Sets & Collections

[sets.md](sets.md "mention") and [collections.md](collections.md "mention") are very similar in their appearance and layout, however they function somewhat differently.

For instance, the [views.md](views.md "mention"),  filters and sorts all work mostly the same, but the way you choose which objects will be shown inside the set / collection is very different. Sets use queries which automatically fetch objects, while collections depend on linking the objects manually.
